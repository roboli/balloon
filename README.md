# balloon

Deflate a nested map into one level deep or inflate a one level into a nested map using delimited keys.

## Quickstart

For installation, add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [org.clojars.roboli/balloon "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]

Import namespace example:

```clojure
(ns balloon.core
  (:require [balloon.core :as b]))
```

Use deflate to flat a nested hash-map:

```clojure
(b/deflate {:my-map {:one "one"
                    :two "two"
                    :any {:other "other"}}
            :my-array [{:a "a"} "b" "c"]})

;;=>
;; {:my-map.one "one",
;;  :my-map.two "two",
;;  :my-map.any.other "other",
;;  :my-array.0.a "a",
;;  :my-array.1 "b",
;;  :my-array.2 "c"}
```

Use inflate to convert a deflated (flatten) hash-map into a nested one:

```clojure
(b/inflate {:my-map.one "one",
            :my-map.two "two",
            :my-map.any.other "other",
            :my-array.0.a "a",
            :my-array.1 "b",
            :my-array.2 "c"})

;;=>
;; {:my-map {:one "one",
;;           :two "two",
;;           :any {:other "other"}},
;;  :my-array [{:a "a"} "b" "c"]}
```

## Usage

There are only two functions: deflate and inflate, each one with its own options.

### Deflate

```clojure
(deflate nested-hash-map :option-1-key option-1-val :option-2-key option-2-val ...)
```

Where options:

* `:delimiter`: Use different delimiter to build delimited keys, defaults to ".".
* `:keep-coll`: Do not flat collections (lists or vectors), defaults to `false`.

### Inflate

```clojure
(deflate flat-hash-map :option-1-key option-1-val :option-2-key option-2-val ...)
```

* `:delimiter`: Use different delimiter to unflat the hash-map delimited keys, defaults to ".".
* `:pre-deflate`: Run deflate on hash-map to guarantee is fully normalized before running unflat process, defaults to `true`.
* `:hash-map`: Unflat indexes in delimited keys as hash-map, not as a collection, defaults to `false`.
